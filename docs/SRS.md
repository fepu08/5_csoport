**Software Requirements Specifications for camping receptionist software**

The purpose of the development is to create a visually detailed web application capable of
managing the slots of a camping site, operated by the receptionist.

The receptionist needs to see which slots are free, reserved or occupied, also be able
to change the state of the slots, and query the open slots in a fixed interval. 
A camping slot can be given to a single tent or caravan with a car.
Electricity is optionally sold for each camping slot. The system should generate
an invoice when the guests are leaving.

The UI needs to contain a grid based on the layout of the camping, each slot representing a single parcel.
The slots have to be distinguished with different colors, based on their state. Clicking on a slot should open
a window with the details of the reservation.

Upon reserving or occupying, a form should appear asking for the details of the reservation. Such as the
name of the guest, the time of staying, the type of accommodation, and whether electricity is required.
After confirmation the slots should switch to an occupied or reserved state.

The invoice should contain the time of stay, the slot the guests used, and the total price of
the service.
